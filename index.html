    <h2>My Design Direction</h2>
    <p>
      As I continue my studies, I am most interested in specialising in
      <strong>interactive and image-based visual design</strong>, especially incorporating
      photography and user experience elements. I enjoy using visuals and interaction
      to tell stories and evoke emotion, and plan to explore this further through both
      web and visual design.I am not only passionate about designing the visual aesthetics of interfaces and pages, but also deeply focused on how to convey information and tell stories through images, animations, and interactive behaviors, aiming to evoke emotional resonance in the audience. Throughout my learning journey, I have gradually come to see photography as an indispensable medium in design—it is not merely a supplement to aesthetics but a core tool for visual storytelling. By capturing emotions, textures, and atmospheres from the real world through photography, I am able to organically integrate these visual elements into web pages or interfaces, thereby enhancing user immersion and engagement. Therefore, in the future, I plan to continue delving into the fields of web and interactive media design, exploring how to maximize the power of photography and visual storytelling through cross-media integration—such as video, motion graphics, sound effects, and interactive programming. I hope to create works with greater emotional warmth and visual impact, establishing a more natural and nuanced connection between people and screens.

    <h2>Project 1 – Personal Video Storytelling</h2>
    <p>
      This assignment required me to use smartphone footage to create a short video that expressed my personality or personal vision. My concept revolved around the theme of <strong>freedom and not caring about judgment</strong> — highlighting how social negativity can cause anxiety, and my desire to push back against that.At the same time, it responds to the widespread negative emotions and collective anxiety in contemporary society. In daily life, I often feel the pressure of external evaluations, which not only shapes people's behavioral patterns but also gradually erodes the courage and authenticity of individual expression. Therefore, I hope to convey an attitude through this short film: Stay alert to external scrutiny, but do not be defined by it; in the crowded social context, insist on being yourself.
    </p >
    <p>
      I shot most footage over a week, ensuring a consistent visual tone with no filters. The process taught me about narrative editing and how visual, sound, and pacing all connect to deliver meaning. This project helped me express myself emotionally through digital media.This "de-modulated" choice not only resonates with the theme, but also enables me to focus more on the direct expression of emotions through the composition of the picture, changes in light and shadow, and the rhythm of movements.
During the post-production stage, I delved deeply into and practiced the techniques of narrative editing, attempting to construct internal emotional threads through the arrangement of footage and the control of rhythm. I paid particular attention to the synchronization between sound and visuals: choosing introspective background music that resonates with the sense of loneliness and liberation depicted in the visuals. This entire project was not just an image experiment, but also an important attempt for me to express myself in digital media. It made me realize that even with the simplest tools (such as a mobile phone camera), as long as there is a clear theme and sincere expression, it can touch people's hearts.

    <h2>Project 2 – Interactive Weather Icon System</h2>
    <p>
      For this project, I designed a set of interactive weather icons using HTML, CSS,
      and JavaScript. The goal was to explore how motion, colour, and interactivity
      could communicate weather conditions effectively. Through this project, I
      developed a better understanding of how microinteractions enhance user
      experience.My primary goal is to explore how dynamic visual effects, color language, and user interaction work together to convey different weather conditions in a more intuitive and vivid manner. Each icon is not just a static symbol but forms an expressive micro-interaction experience through animations, transitions, and responses to user actions. During the design process, I paid special attention to the role of color in perception, such as using bright warm tones to represent sunny weather and cool, low-saturation colors to express overcast or snowy conditions, while ensuring visual consistency and readability. Additionally, I considered the responsive experience across different devices, ensuring that the icons remain clear, aesthetically pleasing, and interactive on various screen sizes, making them particularly suitable for children's education.

    <h2>Project 3 – 3D Interactive World: "Little World Dance Party"</h2>
    <p>
      In this 3D modeling project, I created an exploratory space themed around an <strong>animal-friendly world</strong>, where players interact with cute creatures through music and motion. The aim was to guide users through an emotional transformation using spatial design, sound, and playful interaction.
    </p >
    <p>
      The scenes include sand dunes with snakes, forests with dancing deer, and beaches with penguins. I learned how to think spatially and narratively — how light, terrain, and movement direct user flow and emotion. The game’s goal is simple: dance with animals and discover joy.
